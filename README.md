# SubDomain-Finder

Every Certificate Transparency log is a record of all publicly trusted digital certificates.
The main goal of Certificate Transparency is to provide a publicly available system of logs, where any domain owner can verify whether a certificate was issued by a trusted CA or issued maliciously, and to prevent users from being tricked by any fraudulent certificates.

This script queries crt.sh to get subdomains publicly available/registered to Certification Authorities and helps in subdomain enumeration.
